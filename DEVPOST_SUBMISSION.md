# BTCUSD - Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoin on Starknet
*Devpost Submission for Starknet Re{Solve} Hackathon*

## Inspiration

Bitcoin holders face a fundamental dilemma: keep their Bitcoin and earn zero yield, or sell it for yield-bearing assets and lose Bitcoin exposure. With over $1 trillion in Bitcoin sitting idle, we saw an opportunity to solve this with Starknet's ultra-low fees and Bitcoin's emerging DeFi ecosystem.

BTCUSD enables Bitcoin holders to maintain their exposure while earning yield through automated farming on Vesu protocol - turning idle Bitcoin into productive capital.

## What it does

BTCUSD is a Bitcoin-collateralized stablecoin that automatically generates yield:

1. **Deposit Bitcoin** ‚Üí Atomiq bridge converts to wBTC on Starknet
2. **Mint BTCUSD** ‚Üí 66.67% LTV (150% collateral ratio) for safety
3. **Earn Yield** ‚Üí Collateral auto-deposited in Vesu for 8% APY
4. **Harvest Rewards** ‚Üí 70% to users, 30% to protocol sustainability

**Key Features:**
- üîí Real Bitcoin collateral via Atomiq's trustless bridge
- üí∞ Automatic yield farming on Vesu protocol
- ‚ö° Lightning-fast transactions on Starknet
- üì± Mobile-first interface with Braavos integration
- üõ°Ô∏è Overcollateralized design with flash loan liquidations

## How we built it

### Smart Contracts (Cairo)
**5 interconnected contracts power the system:**

- **BTCUSDToken** - ERC-20 stablecoin with vault-only minting controls
- **BTCUSDVault** - Core collateralization logic with 150% minimum ratio
- **YieldManager** - Vesu integration with custom lending hooks
- **AtomiqAdapter** - Bitcoin bridge monitoring and wBTC management
- **VesuHook** - Auto-compounding yield strategies and flash loans

### Mobile App (React Native + Expo)
**Mobile-optimized interface featuring:**

- Beautiful gradient design with Bitcoin orange branding
- Braavos wallet integration for Bitcoin support
- Real-time position monitoring with health indicators
- One-tap yield harvesting with visual feedback
- Starknet.js integration for seamless blockchain interaction

### Technical Architecture

## Challenges we ran into

1. **Cairo Version Compatibility** - OpenZeppelin contracts had breaking changes between versions. Solved by creating simplified, custom implementations.

2. **Mobile Bridge Integration** - Connecting Bitcoin wallets to React Native required careful Starknet.js configuration and wallet adapter patterns.

3. **Yield Hook Complexity** - Integrating with Vesu's lending hooks while maintaining gas efficiency required custom Cairo implementations.

4. **Liquidation Safety** - Designing flash loan liquidations that protect both users and protocol required careful economic modeling.
